# Machine_Learning_with_Python_Course_Tracking
This repository tracks my learning journey through the Machine Learning with Python course.
The course covers the fundamentals of Machine Learning, including topics such as:

Supervised Learning: Linear regression, decision trees, etc.
Unsupervised Learning: Clustering and dimensionality reduction.
Model Evaluation: Performance metrics and cross-validation.
Advanced Topics: Neural networks, deep learning, and more.

**Learning Goals**

Master core Machine Learning algorithms in Python.
Gain hands-on experience in implementing models and algorithms using Python libraries (e.g., Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras).
Apply learned techniques to real-world datasets.
Build confidence in deploying machine learning models.
